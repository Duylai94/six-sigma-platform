```
General Knowledge (G1-G50):        11 random questions
Define Phase (D1-D75):             20 random questions  
Measure Phase (M1-M125):           20 random questions

                                   ─────────────────
                          TOTAL:   100 questions
```

## How to Create Unlimited Unique Exams

**Method 1 - Manual Random Selection:**
1. Get random number generator or shuffle app
2. From 01_General_50Q.md: Pick 11 questions randomly (e.g., G5, G12, G8, G42, G3, G28, G9, G31, G15, G37, G47)
3. From 02_Define_75Q.md: Pick 20 questions randomly
4. From 03_Measure_125Q.md: Pick 20 questions randomly
5. From 04_Analyze_150Q.md: Pick 18 questions randomly
6. From 05_Improve_75Q.md: Pick 16 questions randomly
7. From 06_Control_125Q.md: Pick 15 questions randomly
8. Compile into exam document
9. **Time it: 100 minutes (1 minute per question)**
10. Score: 77/100 = passing; target 82-90

**Method 2 - By Topic Rotation:**
- **Exam 1**: Questions 1-11 (G), 1-20 (D), 1-20 (M), 1-18 (A), 1-16 (I), 1-15 (C)
- **Exam 2**: Questions 12-22 (G cycling), 21-40 (D), 21-40 (M), 19-36 (A), 17-32 (I), 16-30 (C)
- **Exam 3**: Different rotation pattern
- **Exam 4+**: Continue patterns or hybrid random

**Method 3 - Weakness-Focused:**
- If struggled on Analyze → increase A questions to 25 in next exam
- If need Lean → add extra from Improve phase
- If weak on SPC → add extra from Control

# ✨ TIPS FOR SUCCESS

✅ **DO:**
- Take full-length timed exams (100 minutes for 100 Q)
- Review wrong answers deeply—understand why
- Use answer explanations to learn concepts
- Create study groups and discuss hard questions
- Take breaks—don't cram everything in one day
- Practice calculations (Cpk, DPMO, sample size)
- Memorize run rules and control chart types
- Understand concepts, not just answers

❌ **DON'T:**
- Memorize answers without understanding
- Skip topics because they seem easy
- Take practice exams without timing
- Study only your weak areas (need balance)
- Review answers without understanding why
- Skip the statistical concepts
- Assume exam is easier than practice
- Postpone studying until last week
